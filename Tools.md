The Makervan should be a makerspace on wheels, which should be able to
operate without external power. That makes it a bit difficult to find
proper tools. So here's what we have or what we plan to have

## Electronics

Probably one of the easiest sets of tools to collect is for a small
electronics workshop

### Soldering

-   Battery-powered soldering iron
-   12V soldering iron

### Measurement and additional tools

-   Multimeter
    -   Most used ones are battery powered, pretty easy
-   Power Supply
    -   DIY, powered by 12V
-   Osciloscope

## Others

-   3D printer

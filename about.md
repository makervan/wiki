MakerVan Labs is a small one-person electronics lab and
kit factory based out of Munich, Germany. We're focussed on open source hardware projects, in a few different areas, such as synthesizers, LoRaWAN/IoT, and renewable energy.

The MakerVan was orignially an idea to bring tools and workshops out to
wherever the van could find a place to park. A few workshops and lost
tools later, we took some of the electronics kits we developed for the
workshops to share them online and start developing more.

Now and then, there are still workshops. But today, there's more
electronics kits, ideas and else.

Lots of people, expecially kids, don't have "real" computers or laptops
anymore. Instead, all they have are phones or tablets. How can we enable
them to to build with microcontrollers such as the Arduino?

## Android

Connect the Arduino to an Android phone or tablet via an USB OTG cable.
Programming can happen using the "ArduinoDroid" Android app.

More information in [this Adafruit
tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/programming-arduino-with-android-and-windows-tablets/).

## iOS

-   IDE: <http://www.arduinocode.info/>
    -   Requires an Agent running on a computer or RPi to work (for
        compiling etc)
-   Upload to Arduino via BLE: <http://www.apploader.info/>
